        <em>Have you ever wondered why youâ€™re here?</em> Why <strong>God</strong> created this 
        earth and placed you on it? If you feel deep in your soul that there
         must be some greater purpose to your
         life than simply existing, you can find answers by turning to God.
        <mark>We believe that</mark> we existed before this earth began, 
        living with God as His children in spirit form. Like 
        a parent sending their child off to school, our Heavenly
         Father sent each of us here so we could gain a physical body
          and learn and grow to become more like Him before someday 
        returning to live in His presence.
