    <h2>What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.</h2>
    <p>
        A "block" tag in HTML takes up the full width available on a line and starts on a new line, while an "inline" tag only takes up the space needed by its content and appears on the same line as surrounding text; examples of block tags include p (paragraph) and div, while inline tags include span and a (anchor link).
    </p>
    <h2>What is normal flow in HTML?</h2>
    <p>
        Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.
    </p>
    <h2>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h2>
    <p>
        In CSS, "float" allows an element to be positioned on the left or right side of its container, enabling text to wrap around it.however, because floated elements are removed from the normal document flow,we need to "clear the float" to ensure that subsequent elements appear below the floated element and not alongside it, maintaining proper layout, especially when dealing with elements like footers that should sit below the entire content area.
    </p>
    <h2>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h2>
    <p>
        In CSS, absolute, fixed, and relative are positioning methods that affect the placement of elements on a web page

    <h2>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h2>
    <p>
        To create "nice" navigation buttons for mobile devices, focus on making them easy to tap, visually clear, appropriately sized, use intuitive icons when necessary, and maintain consistency across your design; prioritize readability with large enough text, appropriate color contrast, and consider using standard design patterns familiar to mobile users.
