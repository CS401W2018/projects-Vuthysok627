        <p>Suzume Iwato is a 17-year-old orphaned high school girl living with her aunt in a town in Kyushu. One day, when she went to school, she met a guy who was looking for a door. She told him that there was a door outside the town. The guy was a protector meant to prevent earthquakes in Japan. When Suzume learned about this, she wanted to join him.</p>
        <p>They worked together to find the door that caused the earthquakes. They finally stopped the earthquakes by defeating the worm that tried to bring them about. Although they faced many trials and temptations to stop, they kept going until they succeeded. This story shows the willingness to protect the Earth and its people with persistence and sacrifice.</p>
