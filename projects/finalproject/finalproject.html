    1. I want to create a website about Cambodia's toursim hotspots. The reason why I want to do this content because I want to promote tourism hotspots in Cambodia.
    There are many beautiful and historical places in the country where many people do not know about them.Therefore, my purpose is extending and promoting about about Cambodia's tourism hotspots. I believe this content will extend more information about Cambodia's hotspots to increase more touristst to visit Cambodia!
    </p>
    <p>
        2. In this content will contain some image that related to the spots and information about the place. 
        In the table will list the information about number of tourists who visit those place annually.
    </p> <br>
    <p>
        3. I will collect information from Google and Youtube for my site.
        Reference : Ministry of tourism of Cambodia and tripadvisor website.
    </p>
    <P> 
        4. I have read and understand the warnings about copyright and cheating for the project </P>
