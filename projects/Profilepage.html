    <p> Aloha! My name is <strong>VUTHY</strong>, from the beautiful country- of Cambodia. 
        I'm a little bais about the country
        because I was born &amp; raised there.
         I'm majoring in Information and technology, 
        and minoring in TESOL Certificate and Foundational Language
        in Japanese.  I'm the first child in my family and relatives
        to come to America for college. Therefore, 
        I want to study the best 
        I can to obtain the best education! In my spare time,
         I prefer to go jogging, hiking and snokling.
    <p>I served a mission in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. 
        There are things I have learnt from the mission that blessed my life:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <ol>
        <li>Study scriptures.</li>
        <li>Consistenly prayer with sinere heart.</li>
        <li>Serving other people.</li> <br>
    </ol>
    </ul>
    </p>
