            Loving and Caring Mom!

        <p class="green">
            When I was young, I had a high fever that caused my whole body to break out in a rash. Without sleeping the whole night, Mom took care of me until I got better.
            That memory is still vivid in my mind. Mom is my hero and inspiration.
            Mom always faces challenges with optimism.
            She rarely complains about her life.
            Although she was born and raised in a poor family
            and never had a chance to go to school,
            She endeavored to earn money to raise me
            and my siblings, with a good life. <strong>Her love for the family is uncoditional. She's my hero and my motivaiton. </strong>
